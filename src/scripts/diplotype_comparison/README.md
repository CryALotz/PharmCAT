# Diplotype Comparison

This folder contains scripts for the following purposes:
1. For clinical calls, identify diplotypes that will always show up together as top-scored calls from PharmCAT.
2. For autogenerated tests, automatically check whether the autogenerated test results are plausible.

## Clinical calls

To obtain the pairs of diplotypes that always show up together as top-scored calls, run the following code:

```shell
python3 compare_diplotype_definition.py -c
```
This returns a tsv file named `predicted_pharmcat_calls.tsv` by default. It has only diplotypes that will show up together as possible calls for unphased data.

## Autogenerated tests

The same `compare_diplotype_definition.py` identifies all diplotypes that are defined by the same genotypes. These diplotypes may have different scores. In PharmCAT, diplotypes with a lower score will show up as alternative calls if the user chooses to output all possible calls. Nonetheless, a computational approach is needed to pas the autogenerated tests.

### 1. without missing positions
Run the following script to generate a reference file that contains all diplotypes defined by the same genotypes.

```shell
python3 compare_diplotype_definition.py
```
The default output is a file also named `predicted_pharmcat_calls.tsv`. The file lists
1. `expected`: expected call for unphased data
2. `actual`: the top-scored call that will be returned by PharmCAT
3. `alternative`: other lower-scored calls defined by the same genotypes as the `actual` call
4. `missing_positions`: a list of positions that are presumed missing
5. `gene`: gene symbols


### 2. with missing positions

```shell
python3 compare_diplotype_definition.py -m True
```

### 3. filter failed tests

Run the following code to pass autogenerated tests. Note that you need to update `test_file_pattern` to denote what autogenerated tests you are evaluating.
```shell
python3 filter_tests.py
```
